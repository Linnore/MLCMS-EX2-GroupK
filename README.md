# MLCMS-EX2-GroupK

## Structure

1. "vadere-master" contains the source codes of vadere. The SIR model and FootStepGroupID processor are modified and integrated.

2. "vadere-master-compiled" contains the java executable files of our modified vadere. They are built using IntelliJ's build-in compiler. They work well as we examined, but still there may exist potential issues. Therefore, it is recommanded to run the source codes in "vadere-master".

3. "vadere-project" contains out vadere project, including scenario files, output files, and screenshots our report used.

4. "pythonsrc" contains all the python codes we wrote/used in this exercises. Especially, the "scenarioLoader" class we developed for task3 is in there.

5. At the root of our repo, jupyter notebooks of the corresponding tasks show the workflow of our solutions. They worth a look if you want to check how we finish the tasks in details.
