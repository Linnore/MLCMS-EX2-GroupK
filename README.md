# MLCMS-EX2-GroupK

## Structure

1. "vadere-master" contains the source codes of modified vadere. The SIR model and FootStepGroupID processor are modified and integrated.

2. "vadere-master-compiled" contains the java executable files of the compiled master vadere. We did not recompiled our modified Vadere into jar file, so the Vadere inside this folder does not work with SIR model.

3. "vadere-project" contains our vadere project, including scenario files, output files, and screenshots that our report used.

4. "vadere-project-supermarket" contains the vadere project specified for the supermarket test.

5. "pythonsrc" contains all the python codes we wrote/used in this exercises. Especially, the "scenarioLoader" class we developed for task3 and the modified Dash Plotly application.

6. At the root of our repo, jupyter notebooks of the corresponding tasks show the workflow of our solutions. They worth a look if you want to check how we finish the tasks in details.
